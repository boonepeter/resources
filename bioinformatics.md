- [Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data course](https://scrnaseq-course.cog.sanger.ac.uk/website/index.html)
  - This walks you through the pipeline from start to finish
- [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - This is the scRNA-seq library that we used some in the lab.
- [Learning bioinformatics at home](https://github.com/harvardinformatics/learning-bioinformatics-at-home)
  - This looks like a pretty good collection of info. A bit advanced.
