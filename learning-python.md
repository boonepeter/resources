# Learning python

`Python` and `R` are both solid programming languages that have a lot of data science/stats tools built in and around them. I decided to learn `Python` first because it is more of a general purpose programming language than `R`. I planned on using for more than just stats (`R` is first and foremost a stats programming language).

I'd recommend picking a tutorial and going through it. But don't spend too long "learning". I find the best way to learn is to start working on something, find a small project or task and try to solve it. Don't try to remember everything...just look up stuff when you get stuck. This keeps me motivated. It's very easy to get lost in the sea of information out there. At some point you just have to start doing it.

Here are some resources I have used. I'll add more as I remember.

## General

- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
  - This is where I started learning Python. It's nice b/c you don't have to worry about installing anything, you just execute code in the browser. I didn't use it for too long b/c it was a little expensive and slow sometimes
- [Official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/)
  - This is a bit dense, but is a good definitive reference. The [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is a good place to start.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  - I'm sure you learn about SO if you don't already know about it. Everyone uses it. If you have a question it's most likely been asked here before.
- [Automate the boring stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  - I have gone through parts of this. People like it because it's fairly practical...gets you started working on stuff.
- [Intro to computer science and Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
  - I don't learn that well w/ videos so I didn't do this one, but MIT has a lot of good courses like this one.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
  - I have found myself following tutorials from freeCodeCamp at various times. 
- [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
  - Jupyter notebooks are used a lot in data science. They work pretty well when you want to interactively execute some code, document it, and display some graphs and figures.
- [Github](https://github.com/)
  - You'll want a github account to be "official." People use it to collaborate on software projects, particularly open source projects. Learning `git` (the underlying technology) is a bit overwhelming, but you don't have to do that to start.
- [r/python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/) and [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)

## Applied

- [Learning bioinformatics at home](https://github.com/harvardinformatics/learning-bioinformatics-at-home)
  - This looks like a pretty good collection of info. A bit advanced.
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/)
  - This is what I used for the image processing that I did in the lab. I still use it some.
- [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - This is the scRNA-seq library that we used some in the lab.
